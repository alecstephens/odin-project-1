        <p>The poodle is the national dog of France, and the French people sure do love their poodles. Despite that, they actually originated in Germany as a duck hunter breed. Their flamboyant coat did serve a practial purpose in the breeds early years.It allowed them to have free range of movement in the water and also protected the vital areas from the cold. Nowadays, the breed is more suited to luxury rather than hunting.</p>
