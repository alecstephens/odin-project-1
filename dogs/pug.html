        <p>The pug was once a companion of ancient Chinese emperor, and at one point the mascot of Holland's royal House of Orange. The pugs status may be slightly different, but they are still adored by millions of people across the globe. They have large round heads and big sparkling eyes. They usually come in silver, apricot-fawn with a black mask, or all black. They make great house pets and don't take much to be happy. They love to love and to be loved in return.</p>
